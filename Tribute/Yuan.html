            <figcaption id="img-caption">Yuan was both professionally and personally interested on rice production. He spent a majority of his time in the field, rather than staying confined in a lab or publishing papers. As such, he played a large role in Chinese agriculture by mentoring and leading others in the field, which helped foster future achievements in Chinese agriculture.</figcaption>

                    <li><span>1970</span> - Beside a railway line in Hainan, he and his team found a particularly important wild variety.[14] Using this one within a breeding programme resulted in varieties with yields improved by 20 - 30% in the late 1970s</li>
                    <li><span>1999</span> - The "Super Rice" Yuan worked on improving showed a 30 percent higher yield, compared to common rice, with a record yield of 17,055 kilograms per hectare being registered in Yongsheng County in Yunnan Province</li>
                    <li><span>2001</span> - 	Awarded State Preeminent Science and Technology Award</li>
